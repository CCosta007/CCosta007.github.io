Purpose:
- Serves as my professional teaching portfolio which will be a running document for my professional career.
- Allows me to demonstrate to potential future employees my technical abilities within digital technologies and also convey my professionalism through design choices
- hosted through GitHub Pages at https://ccosta007.github.io/

Pages:
- Home: A basic intro about myself
- About: details about my background, professional journey and future goals
- Resume: where my resume can be viewed and downloaded
- Pedagogy: My philosophy of teaching, values I hold, and approach to behavioural management within the classroom
- Resources: Some resources I have developed that either other teachers can use if visiting, or for employees to have an example of what I've created
- Contact: A place people can contact me to ask questions

Design goals:
- clean and minimal layout so the content is easy to focus on and visually balanced
- Responsive across all devices
- Having a modern and professional aesthetic

Accessibility
- Semantic HTML has been used for use with screen readers
- navigation menu can be used through the tab key for non-mouse users
- alt text for each image
- A dark mode button to help reduce eye strain
- responsive layout for smaller screens such as mobile. e.g. the nav bar is different so it doesn't get cut off or overflow

I utilized the "stellar" template from html5up.net as the framework for this portfolio. Details are listed below:

Say hello to Stellar, a slick little one-pager with a super vibrant color palette (which
I guess you can always tone down if it's a little too vibrant for you), a "sticky" in-page
nav bar (powered by my Scrollex plugin), a separate generic page template (just in case
you need one), and an assortment of pre-styled elements.
