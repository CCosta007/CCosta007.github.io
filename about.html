                    <p class="main-text-1">My name is Chase Costa and I am a university student studying a Bachelors degree in Education (Secondary) and Arts (Mathematics) at <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au" target="_blank"> Australian Catholic University.</a> Prior to studying education, I studied Computer Science at Monash University.</p>   
                    <p class="main-text-2">I also work at <a href="https://www.buckleyparkco.vic.edu.au/"> Buckley Park College</a> in Essendon within the education support team. I currently run a numeracy program for students who are below expected level with numeracy. I also work in the clasroom with students who have additional needs.</p>
                    <p class="main-text-3">I feel so privileged to be able to help make education as equitable and accessible for as many students as possible, and will continue to work as hard as I can to achieve this. If there are any questions please don't hesitate to contact me!</p>

                <h2>Future Goals</h2>
                <p>Looking ahead, I want to build classrooms where students feel comfortable taking risks and exploring new ideas in both maths and technology. My goal is to make learning practical, creative, and fun, so that students see how these skills connect to everyday life and future opportunities. I also hope to keep learning myselfâ€”trying out new tools, working with colleagues, and finding fresh ways to support every student.</p>
