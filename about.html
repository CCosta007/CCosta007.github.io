                <p> My name is Chase Costa and I am a university student studying a Bachelors degree in Education (Secondary) and Arts (Mathematics) at <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au" target="_blank"> Australian Catholic University.</a> Prior to studying education, I studied Computer Science at Monash University. I also work at <a href="https://www.buckleyparkco.vic.edu.au/"> Buckley Park College</a> in Essendon within the education support team. I currently run a numeracy program for students who are below expected level with numeracy. I also work in the clasroom with students who have additional needs. I feel so privileged to be able to help make education as equitable and accessible for as many students as possible, and will continue to work as hard as I can to achieve this. If there are any questions please don't hesitate to contact me!</p>
