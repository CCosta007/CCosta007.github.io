  About me page:
    - Ensure banner picture scales with size and doesn't exceed the container
    - Break up the text. Structure will look more like:
                HEADER
                some text (My name is Chase Costa and I am a university student studying a Bachelors degree in Education (Secondary) and Arts (Mathematics) at Australian Catholic University. Prior to studying education, I studied Computer Science at Monash University.)

                more text (I also work at Buckley Park College in Essendon within the education support team. I currently run a numeracy program for students who are below expected level with numeracy. I also work in the clasroom with students who have additional needs. )

                Final sentences (I feel so privileged to be able to help make education as equitable and accessible for as many students as possible, and will continue to work as hard as I can to achieve this. If there are any questions please don't hesitate to contact me!)
