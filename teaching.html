                <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I believe that all students are infinitely unique and infinitely interesting. They each have something special to offer, and I see it as my role to help cultivate whatever this may be. I emphasise the relational aspect of teaching, taking the time to get to know the whole student; academically, socially, and emotionally, to ensure every learner feels safe, respected, and connected to their peers and the broader community. I aim to create a classroom culture where curiosity, collaboration, and empathy are valued alongside academic achievement. I also exhibit high expectations and a strong work ethic in my role, modelling these traits to inspire a growth mindset in my students.</p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>Relationships: </dt> 
                            <dd> I believe that trust and connection are the foundation of meaningful learning. Strong relationships create a safe environment where students feel supported to take risks.</dd>
                        <dt>Growth Mindset: </dt> 
                            <dd> I encourage students to see mistakes as stepping stones toward improvement, helping them build resilience and confidence in their own learning journey.</dd>
                        <dt>Inclusion: </dt>
                            <dd>Every student deserves to feel valued and represented. I adapt my teaching to meet diverse needs so that all learners can participate fully.</dd>
                        <dt>Curiosity: </dt> 
                            <dd>I aim to spark a love of discovery, encouraging students to ask questions, explore new ideas, and take ownership of their learning.</dd>

            <div class="behavioural-management">
                <h2>Behavioural Management</h2>
                <p>My approach to behaviour management is grounded in Positive Behaviour Support (PBS), using the three-tiered framework to provide universal strategies for all students, targeted supports for those who need additional guidance, and intensive interventions when required. I believe behaviour management is not just about discipline, but about equity and inclusion, ensuring every student has the opportunity to feel safe, respected, and able to learn. Through a social justice lens, I aim to understand the diverse backgrounds and challenges students may face, and to respond with fairness, empathy, and culturally responsive practices that build a positive, supportive classroom community.</p>
